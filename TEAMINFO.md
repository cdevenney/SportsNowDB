## Project Summary

Sports NOW

The concept of our application is to create a web page for users to view their favorite sports and the current stats of the players and teams the user wants to follow. Furthermore, we will have a section for searching the database for specific filters in regards to teams, sports, and athletes. Ultimately, we want to provide the user with a personalized sports webpage where they can see their favorite sports teams and athletes and how theyâ€™re performing during the season.
